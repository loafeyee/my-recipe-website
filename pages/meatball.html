    <p>
      These aren't your average, run-of-the-mill meatballs, folks. This recipe, passed down through… ahem… generations of the Forger family, is a culinary experience unlike any other. Yor Forger's famous (or infamous, depending on who you ask) meatballs are a dish that will leave a lasting impression. Some might describe that impression as "unique," "unforgettable," or even "slightly metallic," but one thing is certain: you won't find meatballs like these anywhere else!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1 lb Ground Meat</strong> (beef, pork, chicken, tofu… whatever's lying around, really)</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup Breadcrumbs</strong> (stale bread Yor found in an alleyway is preferred, but store-bought works too)</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 cup Milk</strong> (or whatever liquid is closest – water, juice, questionable-looking broth)</li>
      <li><strong>1 Egg</strong> (cracked, shelled, hopefully not rotten)</li>
      <li><strong>1 Onion</strong> (diced…ish. Roughly chopped is also acceptable. Whole is a bold choice.)</li>
      <li><strong>2 cloves Garlic</strong> (minced… or smashed. Crushed underfoot in a pinch.)</li>
      <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Salt, Pepper , Other stuff (Yor grabs whatever looks interesting from the back of the cupboard. Use your imagination!)</li>
      <li><strong>Secret Ingredient:</strong> (Yor never reveals this, but we suspect it involves a pinch of something she uses to subdue rogue spies. Probably just MSG.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p><strong>The Mix:</strong> In a large bowl (preferably one that can withstand blunt force), combine the ground meat, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, onion, garlic, and spices. Mix thoroughly. And by thoroughly, we mean really get in there. Imagine you're kneading a particularly stubborn enemy into submission.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p><strong>The Shaping:</strong> Now, form the mixture into meatballs. Size is irrelevant. Go big or go home! Remember, these are "Hearty" Surprise Meatballs, not dainty little nibbles.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p><strong>The Cooking:</strong> This is where things get interesting. Yor's preferred method involves pan-frying the meatballs until they're charred on the outside and questionably raw on the inside. However, you can bake them, simmer them in sauce, or even throw them directly into a volcano. The choice is yours! (Just kidding about the volcano. Mostly.)</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p><strong>The Serving:</strong> Serve immediately. Preferably with a side of something bland to counteract the… intensity of the meatballs. Rice, mashed potatoes, or a hazmat suit are all good options.</p>
    <h2>Yor's Tips & Tricks:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><em>"If the meatballs are too dry, add more liquid. If they're too wet, add more breadcrumbs. If they're sentient, you've gone too far."</em></li>
      <li><em>"Don't be afraid to experiment with spices! Just make sure you have a fire extinguisher handy."</em></li>
      <li><em>"If your family starts exhibiting superhuman strength or developing telepathic abilities, consult a doctor. Or a spy agency."</em></li>
    </ol>
